## ðŸ—³ Justification
I didn't want to practice with common and simple applications like arithmetic calculations, algorithms implementations, and those kinds of things; otherwise, I wanted to prove the versatility and potential that Powershell has by belonging to theÂ .NET Platform, I mean if Python is a scripting language and has a bunch of cool frameworks, why does Powershell can't do the same?
